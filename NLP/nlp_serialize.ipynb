      "[b\"Dear Diana,\\n\\nWe hope this message finds you well. We wanted to update you on the predicted solar power generated by your solar panels on February 27th, 2024 at 2 pm. Based on our analysis, we predict that you will generate approximately 8.286 kilo Watts of power during this time. \\n\\nHowever, we would like to note that the predicted hourly precipitation and temperature values for that hour have a negative impact on the power generated. While you can use your heater and dishwasher without surpassing the generated power, we recommend avoiding the use of your air conditioner as it might exceed the generated power. Additionally, we advise against using the washing machine as it will definitely exceed the generated power.\\n\\nAs always, we are committed to helping you maximize the potential of your solar panels. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.\\n\\nBest,\\nTenergito\"\n",
      " b'Report Date: February 17th, 2023\\nTime: 16:00\\n\\nDear Lu\\xc3\\xads,\\n\\nWe are pleased to inform you that based on our solar power predictive analysis, the solar power generated from your solar panels at 16:00 today will be very high. The estimated power generation is 5.4 kW, which is enough to support your household needs without any issues.\\n\\nAfter analyzing the data, we found that the high solar power generation is attributed to the favorable temperature conditions and significant positive solar radiation. The temperature and solar radiation are critical factors that influence the power generation of the solar panels, and we predict that it will continue to perform well throughout the day.\\n\\nWe suggest that you take advantage of this high solar power generation to use your air conditioner and heater without exceeding the power generation capacity. This will ensure that you maximize your usage of solar power while not exceeding the generated power and avoiding any additional charges.\\n\\nWe hope this report helps you make informed decisions about your energy consumption, and we look forward to continuing to provide you with valuable information about your solar power generation in the future.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nTenergito team.'\n",
      " b\"Dear Diana,\\n\\nWe hope this email finds you well. As your solar power prediction service provider, we would like to inform you that on November 3rd, 2023 at 20 o'clock, the solar power generated from your panels will be very low at 0.6 kilo Watts. This is due to the predicted hourly precipitation having a negative impact on your solar power generation.\\n\\nWe wanted to bring to your attention that your air conditioning unit might exceed the generated power during this time. Additionally, your water heater, heater, dishwasher, and washing machine will definitely exceed the generated power.\\n\\nWe recommend that you reduce your energy consumption during this time to avoid exceeding the generated power and incurring additional charges from your energy provider.\\n\\nPlease let us know if you have any questions or concerns.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nTenergito\"\n",
      " b\"Dear Pedro,\\n\\nWe wanted to provide you with an update on the solar power generated by your solar panels on January 1st, 2024 at 9 o'clock. Unfortunately, due to the predicted value of solar radiation and daily rain, the solar power generated was very low at 2.286 kilo Watts. This means that your appliances, specifically your dishwasher and heater, exceeded the amount of generated power significantly.\\n\\nWe recommend that you consider alternative sources of power during times when solar radiation and daily rain are predicted to have a negative impact to ensure that your appliances are able to operate efficiently. Additionally, we suggest that you monitor the weather forecast regularly to make any necessary adjustments to your power consumption.\\n\\nIf you have any questions or concerns about the solar power generated by your panels, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nTenergito\"\n",

Here are the details:\\n\\nGenerated Power: 5.667 kW\\n\\nTemperature: 85\\xc2\\xb0F\\n\\nAppliances Usable:\\n\\n- Heater\\n- Water Heater\\n- Air Conditioner\\n\\nAppliances Not Usable:\\n\\n- Dishwasher\\n\\nThe solar power generated by your solar panels at this time is predicted to be very high, which means you can use your heater, water heater, and air conditioner without any issues. However, your dishwasher might exceed the generated power, so it is recommended to avoid using it during this time.\\n\\nPlease note that the predicted values may not be accurate due to various factors such as weather conditions, panel efficiency, and maintenance. However, we have tried our best to provide you with the most reliable prediction based on the available data.\\n\\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nTenergito'], shape=(5,), dtype=string)\n"
