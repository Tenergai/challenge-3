This is due to a significant negative impact from both the predicted daily rain value and solar radiation predicted value.\\n\\nIt is important to note that, based on our calculations, your appliance(s) - specifically your water heater and heater - will exceed the generated power on this day. Therefore, we recommend taking steps to reduce their usage or find alternative power sources if possible.\\n\\nWe understand the importance of reliable solar power and will continue to monitor and provide updates on predicted power generation in the future.\\n\\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nTenergito\"\n",
      " b\"Dear Tom\\xc3\\xa1s,\\n\\nWe are pleased to inform you that on June 19th, 2024, at 10 o'clock, the solar panels installed on your property are expected to generate a high amount of solar power of up to 10.0 kilo Watts. This prediction is based on the solar radiation that is expected to be at a positive contribution.\\n\\nBased on this prediction, we advise that you use your water heater and dishwasher during this time frame as it will not surpass the generated power. However, we advise against using your washing machine as it might exceed the generated power.\\n\\nPlease feel free to contact us if you have any questions or concerns about this report or any other aspect of your solar panel system.\\n\\nThank you for your continued trust in us.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nTenergito\"\n",

We recommend monitoring your solar power generation and usage closely to ensure optimal efficiency and cost savings.\\n\\nThank you for choosing our services.
