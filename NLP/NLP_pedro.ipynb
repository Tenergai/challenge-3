Additionally, your air conditioner will definitely surpass the generated power, so we advise against using it during this time.\\n\\nWe hope this report helps you plan your energy usage and make the most of the solar power generated by your panels.

Based on our predictive model, on May 22nd, 2024, at 12 o'clock, the solar power generated will be very high at 3.68 kilo Watts.\\n\\nThis increase in solar power generation is primarily due to the predicted temperature being higher than usual, and solar radiation having a significant positive contribution. This means that during this time, you can use your water heater and other heaters without exceeding the generated power.\\n\\nHowever, we recommend caution when using your dishwasher, as it might exceed the generated power.
