I am trying to build small reports for my clients relative to generated solar power predictions from their solar panels.
Take for instance that, for my client #client#, the solar power generated will be #solar_power_cat# (#solar_power_num# kilo Watts) due to #explanation#.
$He can use his #use_devices#, since it won't surpass the generated power.
$His #uncertain_devices# might exceed the generated power.
$Regarding his #nouse_devices#, it will exceed the generated power.$ 
Can you build me a small report for my client with this information?
