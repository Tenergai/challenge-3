Dear Pedro,\n\nWe are pleased to provide you with a solar power prediction report generated from your solar panels. \n\nBased on the current moderate ambient temperature of 20 degrees Celsius, your solar panels are predicted to generate approximately 1 kilo Watt of power. This indicates a high power generation capacity which can be utilized for various home appliances. \n\nWe would like to inform you that you can use your washing machine with ease as it falls well within the generated power capacity. However, we would like to advise you that your dishwasher and air conditioner might exceed the generated power capacity and may require additional power sources. Your water heater also exceeds the generated power capacity, making it necessary for you to conserve energy and use it judiciously. \n\nWe hope you find this information useful and informative.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
